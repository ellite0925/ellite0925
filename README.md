## 🧐 Who Am I?
- 🔭 **Senior Developer** with a knack for solving problems I created in the first place.
- 🧠 Expert in **MERN stack** (which stands for "My Errors Remain Numerous").
- 💡 My job is 10% coding and 90% Googling the stuff I forgot.
- 🐛 Debugging: It's like being a detective, but without the cool trench coat... or the paycheck.

## 🛠 What I Do (When I'm Not Breaking Stuff)
- **MongoDB**: I'm basically a wizard, but my spells sometimes need retries.
- **Express**: Perfect for making "get-rich-quick" APIs that never make me rich.
- **React**: I speak fluent JSX. My life is divided into two parts: before hooks and after hooks.
- **Node.js**: If it runs on JavaScript, I'm the person who can accidentally make it crash.

## ⚡ Fun Facts:
- I can fix any bug... if you give me enough time, coffee, and a rubber duck.
- I once deployed to production on a Friday and lived to tell the tale. 👑
- I believe **console.log()** is the true debugger’s tool. Change my mind.
- **StackOverflow** badges? I collect them like Pokémon.

## 🚀 When I’m Not Coding:
- 🍕 Eating pizza like I’m getting paid for it.
- 🎮 Pretending video games are "stress tests" for my PC.
- 🧩 Writing "clean code" and then making it "dirty" again after realizing it doesn’t work.
